ABANDONED PROJECT

A simple chess game for two players. Does not come with an AI or anything, but has pretty much everything you'd need, including castling and En Passant, and an ability to reverse moves.

Old Chess pieces by Lucas312 over at OpenGameArt.org, currently used design by Deja View at itch.io. Kudos!
